WinPrint - A modern take on the the classic source code printing app from [1988](https://www.kindel.com/products/winprint/).

WinPrint is the perfect tool for printing source code, web pages, reports generated by legacy systems, documentation, or any text or HTML file. It works interactively or from the command line making it great for single users or whole enterprises.

## Features

* Cross platform. Even though it's named **Win**Print, it works on Windows, Linux (command line only), and (not yet tested) Mac OS.
* Use from the Command Line/Console or GUI.
* Print source code with syntax highlighting and line numbering for over 200 programming langauges and file formats.
* Print "multiple-pages-up" on one piece of paper (saves trees!)
* Complete control over all page formatting options, including headers and footers, margins, fonts, page orientation, etc...
* Simple and elegant graphical user interface with accurate print preview.
* Complete command line interface. Allows WinPrint to be used from other applications or solutions.
* Sheet Definitions make it easy to save settings for frequent print jobs.
* Headers and Footers support detailed file and print information macros with rich date/time formatting.

## Install

WinPrint 2.0 is in pre-beta (alpha) stage. I'm embarrased by a few bugs and performance issues that I want to fix before I declare beta; see Issues.

Go to Releases to grab the latest MSI for Windows and give it a try.

## History

Ever since I started programming on an Apple ][+ in 1981, I've had a thing for printing. My earliest apps focused on printing and my first money-making endeavor was "Tapes", which printed casette tape '[J-cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-card)' for all the mix-tapes of great '80s music we made for the girls. Whenever I learned a new programming language or OS, the first app I'd write was '[Spit](https://github.com/tig/Tigger/blob/a2013af12fef6d9946adea7fe510f8c649766160/College/C_SRC/SPIT153.C)', an app for printing my source code all pretty (it "spits" source code out of a printer). Over the years, I wrote Spit for AppleDOS (Apple BASIC), UCSD-Pascal, CP/M (Turbo Pascal), DOS (8086 assembly and C), VAX/VMS (Pascal and FORTRAN-77), and Mac (Pascal).

In 1988, as a College Senior, I decided Windows was going to win (over OS/2) and I was going to work for Microsoft. I bought Charles Petzold's "Programming Windows" and conned my dad into buying me a copy of the Windows 2.0 SDK (which was like $300 back then!). On my amazeballs ALR 386/33 PC I set about becoming a Windows programmer. The first (useful) app I wrote was WinSpit. In a rare moment of adulting, I renamed it [WinPrint and listed it on CompuServe](http://www.kindel.com/products/winprint/) as shareware ($25). For the next 10 years those $25 checks just arrived in the mail. Even better, WinPrint demonstrated to Microsoft I could actually, really write code. So they hired me.

Several times in the early 1990s I started writing WinPrint 2.0. Each time I had the basics working and realized three things: 1) Nobody cares about printing source code, 3) I'd over-engineered things, and 2) the technology I choose was already dated (e.g. MFC). Two of those abandoned efforts can be found in my archive [here (1992)](https://github.com/tig/Tigger/tree/master/Shareware/WINPRT2/WINPRINT) and [here (1994)](https://github.com/tig/Tigger/tree/master/Shareware/WINPRT2/WINPRT20).

Last year (2019) I got a wild-hair to write some code as a way of blowing off steam, and proving to myself I was still cool. It all started with MS releasing the [Cascadia Code](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/cascadia-code/) font. I have a thing for fixed-pitch fonts. It's weird. Anyway, I installed the font in Terminal and VScode but just looking at stuff wasn't enough. I needed to *use the font in anger*!. So I fixed some long-standing issues in [MCE Controller](https://tig.github.io/mcec/) (another app I wrote that nobody uses anymore).

This all led to me accidentally finding the old WinPrint 2.0 source code. Reminiscing on how much time I wasted back then, I just had to try again. So I did. And, just to be clear, here's what I did:

1) I wrote a *printing* app in 2019-2020. Nobody prints these days. *I* don't even print anymore. 
2) I over-engineered it. It has a full GUI with print preview. Headers and Footers with *Macros*. A full command-line interface. It can syntax-highlight over 200 different programming languages. It's cross-platfom. And more.
3) I used .NET and C#. Ok, this part I can defend (assuming you get past point #1 and #2): First, I know C# well and it is awesome. Second, no other modern language/app-framework can even SPELL "print". I tried both Electron and Flutter and both suck when it comes to printing.

So, there you are. I present to you WinPrint 2.0. I hope you enjoy it.
